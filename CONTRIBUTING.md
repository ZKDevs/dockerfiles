## Getting Started

2. **Docker Images**: If you want to contribute Docker images to this project, please follow these guidelines:

   - Each new Docker image must have a specific purpose and use case. It should not be a generic image but rather serve a particular function. For example, a "fast-api" image should be tailored to help users quickly set up a FastAPI environment.

   - Create a new directory in the project's repository for your Docker image, and name it accordingly (e.g., `fast-api`).

   - Inside the directory, include all the necessary files, such as Dockerfiles and any supporting scripts or configuration files.

   - Update the project's workflows files to build and test your new Docker image. Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline can successfully build and test your image.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: To submit your contribution, follow these steps:

   - Create a new branch in your fork of the repository for your changes.

   - Make your changes, commit them, and push them to your branch.

   - Open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the project's repository.

   - Provide a clear and informative title and description for your PR. Include references to any related issues, if applicable.

   - Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers, and any necessary feedback or changes will be discussed.

4. **Collaboration**: Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on the feedback received during the review process. Collaboration is essential to maintain code quality and consistency.
